this program is distrbuted under the GNU General Public License v3.

and you can edit this script at your heart's content!


COMMAND LINE
=============
there are a lot of commandline options with wifite. check them out!
./wifite.py -help
this is so you can make a one-liner that does everything you want.
throw that line into a script on the desktop and it's one click away!


TIPS & TRICKS
=============
Ctrl+C options (during attacks):
  if your WEP method isn't working,Ctrl+C gives options to move on
  if you want to move onto cracking the next target
  if you want to skip targets and move onto WPA cracking
  if you want to stop and exit the program immediately


the -p (--power) option is to filter out APs that are too far away
each wifi card is different, so it's up to you to find the power 
level where attacks fail.


in wifite.py, change:
   DICT=''
to:
   DICT='your/favorite/wordlist.txt'
and you'll never get prompted for a wordlist again!
the program will automatically use the wordlist you enter.

alternatively, change the line to:
   DICT='none'
and you'll never get prompted for a wordlist, 
but it will never crack WPA! it will only save captured handshakes.


there's other options to edit in wifite.py:
 -default WEP/WPA_MAXWAIT (how long before giving up on an attack)
 -WEP_PPS (packets per second)
 -all wep attack methods (WEP_CHOP _ARP _FRAG _P0841),
     *set these =False to skip the attack method
these save you from typing the command-line equivalents everytime.


BIG RED BUTTON MODE
./wifite.py -all
