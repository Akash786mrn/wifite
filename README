ABOUT
=============
automates aircrack-ng suite to crack WEP/WPA encrypted network(s).
...one step closer to the "big red button"


REQUIRED
=============
python
aircrack-ng suite:
    aircrack-ng, airmon-ng, airodump-ng
    aireplay-ng, packetforge-ng
macchanger (only if CHANGE_MAC is set to True)
various linux tools:
    echo, rm, cp, ls, killall,
    ifconfig, iwconfig, wc


TESTED USING

COPYING
=============
this program is distrbuted under the GNU General Public License v3.
the GPL is available here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt

feel free to distrubte this script for non-commercial purposes.
you can edit this script at your heart's content!


COMMAND LINE
=============
there are a lot of command-line options with wifite. check them out!
./wifite.py -help
these options are so you can make a one-liner that does whatever you want.
throw that line into a script on the desktop and it's one click away!


TIPS & TRICKS
=============
i recommend moving or copying your favorite WPA dictionary to this dir.
put wordlist.txt in the same directory as this script and wifite will
  use that list whenever it needs to crack a WPA...
 ... and it will never ask for you to enter a wordlist again!

alternatively, in wifite.py, change:
   DICT=''
to:
   DICT='/your/favorite/wordlist.txt'
and the program will automatically use that wordlist instead of prompting.


the -p (--power) option is to filter out APs that are too far away
each wifi card is different, so it's up to you to find the power level
where attacks fail.
example: ./wifite.py -p 55


interrupt options (during both WEP and WPA attacks):
  pressing Ctrl+C (interrupt) during an attack will bring up a list of options
  -move onto the next WEP method -- frag, chopchop, etc (WEP only)
  -move onto the next target in the attack list
  -skip attacks and move onto WPA cracking
  -stop and exit the program immediately


there's options you can edit in wifite.py (to save yourself some time):
 -CHANGE_MAC : default is False. when True, changes mac address to a client's
 -default WEP/WPA_MAXWAIT (how long before giving up on an attack)
 -WEP_PPS (packets per second)
 -all wep attack methods (WEP_CHOP _ARP _FRAG _P0841),
     *set these =False to skip the attack method
these save you from typing the command-line equivalents everytime.



BIG RED BUTTON MODE
===================
attempt to crack every nearby network, using darkc0de's wordlist:

./wifite.py -all -d /pentest/passwords/wordlists/darkc0de.txt
