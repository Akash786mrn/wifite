  SETTINGS
  -i, --iface	     e.g. -i wlan0
             	 wireless interface
             	 the program automatically selects a wifi device in monitor mode
             	 prompts for input if no monitor-mode devices are found
             	 using this switch avoids the prompt

  -d, --dict	     e.g. -d /pentest/passwords/wordlists/darkc0de.lst
             	 dictionary file for WPA cracking
             	 the program will prompt for a wordlist file if any WPA targets
             	 are selected for attack. using -d avoids this prompt
             	 defaults to "wordlist.txt" found in same directory as wifite.py
             	     e.g. -d "none"
             	 does not attempt to crack WPA handshakes
             	 only captures the wpa handshake and backs it up to hs/

  --wpa-wait	     e.g. -wpaw 15
          	 sets the maximum time to wait for a wpa handshake (in minutes)
          	 enter "0" to wait endlessly

  --no-strip	 strip non-handshake packets from .cap file
         	 uses pyrit (or tshark) to strip out unnecessary packets.
         	 greatly reduces the size of handshkae cap files

  --wep-wait	     e.g. -wepw 10
          	 sets the maximum time to wait for each WEP attack.
          	 depending on the settings, this could take a long time
          	 if the wait is 10 min, then EACH METHOD of attack gets 10 min
          	 if you have all 4 WEP attacks selected, it would take 40 min
          	 enter "0" to wait endlessly

  --pps		     e.g. -pps 400
          	 packets-per-second; only for WEP attacks.
          	 more pps means more captured IVs, which means a faster crack
          	 select smaller pps for weaker wifi cards and distant APs

  --change-mac	 changes mac address of interface to a client's mac (if found)
          	 only affects WEP-based attacks

  --no-arp	 WEP disables arp-replay attack
  --no-chop	 WEP disables chop-chop attack
  --no-frag	 WEP disables fragmentation attack
  --no-p0841	 WEP disables -p0841 attack

  --force-auth	 during a WEP attack: if fake-auth fails, the attack ends
              	 most WEP attacks require fake-authentication
              	 default is to "stay the course" and hope for more packets

  --no-deauth	 disables the deauthing of clients on hidden APs
             	 by default, wifite will deauth clients connected to hidden APs
             	 *wifite only deauths hidden SSID clients in FIXED CHANNEL MODE*

  --no-color	 do not display annoying colors (use system colors)


  FILTERS
  -e, --essid	     e.g. -e "2WIRE759"
             	 essid (name) of the access point (router)
             	 this forces a narrow attack; no other networks will be attacked

  -all, --all	 target and attack all access points found
           	 this is dangerous because most attacks require injection,
           	 most wifi cards cann;t inject unless they are close to the AP

  -p, --power	     e.g. -p 55
             	 minimum power level (dB)
             	 this is similar to the "-e all" option, except it filters APs
             	 that are too far away for the attacks to be useful

  -c, --channel	     e.g. -c 6
               	 channel to scan
               	 not using this switch defaults to all possible channels
               	 only use -c or --channel if you know the channel to listen on

  --no-wpa	 ignores all WPA-encrypted networks
          	 useful when using --power or "-e all" attacks

  --no-wep	 ignores all WEP-encrypted networks
          	 useful when using filtered attacks like -p or "-e all"
