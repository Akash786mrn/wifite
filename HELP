WIFITE
======================
EXTENDED HELP


Usage: python wifite.py [SETTINGS] [FILTERS]

  SETTINGS
  -i, --iface        e.g. -i wlan0
                 wireless interface
                 the program automatically selects a wifi device in monitor mode
                 prompts for input if no monitor-mode devices are found

  -d, --dict         e.g. -d /pentest/passwords/wordlists/darkc0de.lst
                 dictionary file for WPA cracking
                 the program will prompt for a dictionary file if any WPA targets
                 are selected for attack. using -d avoids this prompt
                 e.g. -d "none"
                 does not attempt to crack WPA handshakes, only captures and stores them

  --wpa-wait         e.g. -wpaw 15
                 sets the maximum time to wait for a wpa handshake (in minutes)
                 enter "0" to wait endlessly

  --wep-wait         e.g. -wepw 10
                 sets the maximum time to wait for each WEP attack.
                 depending on the settings, this could take a long time
                 if the wait is "10 minutes", then EACH METHOD of attack gets 10 minutes
                 if you have all 4 attacks (arp, frag, chop, 0841), it would take 40 minutes
                 enter "0" to wait endlessly

  --pps              e.g. -pps 400
                 packets-per-second (used only by WEP attacks) - larger pps means more ivs
                 however, smaller pps is recommended for weaker access points (or far-away APs)

  --change-mac   chanes mac address of interface to a client's mac (if found)
                 only affects WEP-based attacks

  --no-color     do not display annoying colors (use system colors)


  FILTERS
  -e, --essid        e.g. -e "2WIRE759"
                 essid (name) of the access point (router)
                 this forces a narrowed attack; no other networks will be attacked

  -all, --all    target and attack all access points found
                 this is dangerous because most attacks require injection, and most
                 wireless cards cannot inject unless they are close to the router

  -p, --power        e.g. -p 55
                 minimum power level (dB)
                 this is similar to the "-e all" option, except it filters
                 access points that are too far away for the attacks to be useful

  -c, --channel      e.g. -c 6
                 channel to scan
                 not using this option causes program to search all possible channels
                 only use -c or --channel if you know the channel you want to listen on

  --no-wpa       ignores all WPA-encrypted networks
                 useful when using --power or "-e all" attacks

  --no-wep       ignores all WEP-encrypted networks
                 useful when using filtered attacks like -p or "-e all"
